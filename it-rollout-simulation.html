      <h2 class="h2">Executive Overview</h2>
      <p class="project-desc">
        To demonstrate readiness for complex technical delivery, I executed a structured simulation of a
        <strong>hypothetical IT system rollout</strong>.
        This project was designed to test the application of core
        <strong>project management principles</strong> in a controlled environment, moving beyond simple task lists to comprehensive project governance.
      </p>
      <p class="project-desc">
        The primary objective was to model the lifecycle of a deployment, ensuring alignment between technical execution
        and business requirements through rigorous documentation and control.
      </p>

        <h3 class="h3">1. Strategic Scope & Dependency Mapping</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          A successful rollout requires a crystal-clear definition of success.
          I established a robust project baseline by <strong>defining the full scope and critical milestones</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 2rem; list-style: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
          <li><strong>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):</strong> Decomposed complex deliverables into manageable work packages.</li>
          <li><strong>Critical Path Analysis:</strong> Mapped out <strong>dependencies</strong> between tasks to identify which activities could impact the overall timeline, ensuring resource bottlenecks were identified early.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
        <h3 class="h3">2. Risk Management Framework</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          Proactive risk management was central to the simulation.
          I authored a comprehensive <strong>Risk Register</strong> to catalog potential technical and operational threats.
        </p>
        <p class="project-desc">
          This involved not just identifying <strong>risks</strong>, but actively assigning
          <strong>mitigation strategies</strong> for each—distinguishing between risks that could be accepted, transferred,
          or required immediate contingency planning to maintain business continuity.

      <h2 class="h2">Operational Execution</h2>
      
      <h3 class="h3">Tracking & Resource Management</h3>
      <p class="project-desc">
        To ensure visibility into project health, I built dynamic
        <strong>task schedules and progress tracking sheets using Excel</strong>.
        This operational layer allowed for the monitoring of timeline adherence and created a single source of truth for project status.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h3" style="margin-top: 2rem;">Stakeholder Communication</h3>
      <p class="project-desc">
        Bridging the gap between data and decision-making, I practiced
        <strong>stakeholder-style reporting</strong>.
        I produced concise <strong>status updates and executive summaries</strong>
        designed to communicate progress, escalate blockers, and maintain alignment across technical and non-technical teams.
