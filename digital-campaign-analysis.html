      <h2 class="h2">Executive Summary</h2>
      <p class="project-desc">
        To bridge the gap between theoretical marketing concepts and operational reality, I executed a comprehensive
        <strong>8-week self-guided simulation</strong> designed to replicate the pressure of a live digital marketing environment.
        This project moved beyond simple content creation to focus on the <strong>analytical infrastructure</strong> required to track success.
      </p>
      <p class="project-desc">
        The core objective was to design a full-cycle campaign—from audience identification to post-mortem analysis—using
        simulated datasets to practice data-driven decision making and optimization.

      <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
        <h3 class="h3">1. Audience Segmentation & Targeting</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          Effective campaigns begin with precision targeting. I developed detailed
          <strong>user personas and segmentation strategies</strong> to ensure resource efficiency.
        </p>
        <ul style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 2rem; list-style: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
          <li><strong>Demographic Profiling:</strong> Defined core audience segments based on age, location, and professional status to align with product fit.</li>
          <li><strong>Psychographic Mapping:</strong> Analyzed potential pain points and motivations to tailor messaging that resonates with specific user needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Channel Strategy:</strong> Mapped specific segments to the most effective acquisition channels, reducing hypothetical wasted ad spend.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
        <h3 class="h3">2. Content & Operational Planning</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          I structured a comprehensive <strong>content calendar</strong> to maintain a consistent brand narrative across a multi-channel environment.
        </p>
        <ul style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 2rem; list-style: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
          <li><strong>Frequency Matrix:</strong> Balanced high-frequency "snackable" content with lower-frequency, high-value assets to maintain engagement without saturation.</li>
          <li><strong>Asset Coordination:</strong> Organized deliverables by format (video, static, carousel) and platform requirements to streamline the hypothetical production workflow.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="h2">Data Infrastructure & Analysis</h2>
      <p class="project-desc">
        The backbone of this project was the development of a robust tracking system.
        I simulated campaign performance using sample datasets to test my ability to interpret raw metrics.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h3">Excel Dashboard Architecture</h3>
      <p class="project-desc">
        I built <strong>Excel trackers</strong> to monitor the health of the campaign through a full-funnel lens.
        This required advanced spreadsheet modeling to translate raw data rows into actionable intelligence.
      </p>
      <ul style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 2rem; list-style: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
        <li><strong>Top-of-Funnel Metrics (Reach):</strong> Monitored impression volume to assess brand awareness and market penetration.</li>
        <li><strong>Mid-Funnel Engagement (CTR):</strong> Analyzed <strong>Click-Through Rates</strong> to evaluate creative resonance and ad copy effectiveness. Low CTRs were flagged as indicators of creative fatigue or poor audience alignment.</li>
        <li><strong>Bottom-of-Funnel (Conversions):</strong> Tracked final conversion events to calculate the hypothetical Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) and overall campaign ROI.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="h2">Insights & Optimization</h2>
      <p class="project-desc">
        Data without action is overhead. The project concluded with the production of a
        <strong>performance report</strong> containing specific insights and <strong>optimization recommendations</strong>.
      </p>
      <div style="background-color: #f3f4f6; padding: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent); border-radius: 4px;">
        <h3 class="h3" style="margin-top: 0;">Key Findings</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0; color: var(--text-muted);">
          The analysis highlighted that while broad targeting delivered high Reach, it suffered from low conversion efficiency.
          By analyzing the data, I determined that <strong>adjusting content types based on early CTR data</strong>—specifically
          shifting budget toward high-engagement video assets—could significantly improve the overall campaign ROI.
