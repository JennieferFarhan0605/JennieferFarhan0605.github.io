        <h3 class="h3">Executive Overview</h3>
        <p>
          This project was engineered to address a critical accessibility gap: minimizing human intervention for mobility devices.
          By integrating Android OS with embedded systems, I developed a hands-free navigation aid that processes acoustic input into mechanical motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system allows users to control a robotic wheelchair using five distinct voice commands
          (Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Stop), translating digital signals into high-torque physical movement.

        <h3 class="h3">1. Power Engineering & Load Management</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          Porting the prototype to a real-world wheelchair presented a significant challenge:
          the system needed to withstand a <strong>load capacity of 80kg</strong>.
          Standard microcontroller outputs are insufficient for the 12V 60RPM DC Geared Motors required for this torque.
        </p>
        <p class="project-desc">
          To solve this, I engineered a power stage using a <strong>Buck Converter (DC-to-DC)</strong>.
          This Switched-Mode Power Supply (SMPS) steps down voltage while stepping up current,
          ensuring the motors receive sufficient drive without draining the battery inefficiently.
          This architecture restricted efficiency losses to just 5–15%, ensuring consistent performance under varying load conditions.
        </p>

      <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
        <h3 class="h3">2. Hardware Interface & Logic</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          The <strong>Arduino Uno</strong> serves as the central processing unit.
          It interfaces with the <strong>L293D Motor Driver</strong>, which acts as a bridge between
          low-voltage logic (5V) and the high-power motor requirements.
        </p>
        <p class="project-desc">
          For directional control, I implemented H-bridge logic.
          To execute a "Left" turn, the system sends a reverse DC supply to the left motor and a positive DC supply to the right motor,
          pivoting the chassis on its axis.
          High-current relays were integrated to safely isolate the microcontroller from the heavy load of the wheelchair motors.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
        <h3 class="h3">3. Signal Processing & Communication</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          The control interface was built using <strong>MIT App Inventor</strong>,
          leveraging Google Speech Recognition to transcode voice input into text strings.
        </p>
        <p class="project-desc">
          These strings are transmitted via the <strong>HC-05 Bluetooth Module</strong> to the Arduino.
          I programmed the microcontroller to initiate serial communication at a baud rate of 9600.
          The code continuously polls for incoming characters; for example, if the data stream contains
          “Forward,” the system triggers Pins 10 and 12 to HIGH, engaging the forward drive sequence.
